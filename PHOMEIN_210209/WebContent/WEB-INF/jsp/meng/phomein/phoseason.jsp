					<strong>Vietnamese Corporation <br>Rice Noodle Factory<br><em>PHO SEASON INC.</em></strong>

						<br/>

						<br/>
						Pho Season is manufacturing ‘Freshly Harvested Rice Noodles’, which is the rice noodle made by our exclusive technology and Herb-Bags for broth made with 9 high quality natural spices. <br/>

					<strong>PhoMein’s Freshly Harvested<br> Rice Noodles made<br>by our exclusive technology</strong>
					<p>
						Pho Season has developed ‘Freshly Harvested Rice Noodles’ that is most suitable for the strict Korean people’s taste based on the independent development of manufacturing machine and the rigid processing technology accumulated by long-time R&D.  <br/>
						<br/>
						Pho Season has also independently developed a strict manufacturing technology by investing a lot of time and money in order to realize the stickiness, which is difficult due to the characteristics of freshly harvested rice. <br/>
						<br/>
						The colors and scents that change by one minute and one second of drying time
						The stickiness that changes by 1℃ of low-temperature ripening
						The manufacturing technology of ‘Freshly Harvested Rice Noodles’ found through numerous tests contains our sincerity and passion. 
						 <br/>
						 <br/>
						In the pho market in Korea that has relied on imported rice noodles whose sources and manufacturing process are unknown, PhoMein and PhoMein RED are the only brands that produce and use rice noodles made by the exclusive technology. <br/>
						<br/>
						The differentiation of PhoMein by the establishment of Pho Season will become a new standard not only in Korea but also in the global pho market. <br/>

								<strong>New Technology, Machine Drying</strong>
								<p>
									Unlike the other obsolete noodle making factories, PHO SEASON has developed the way of drying rice noodles by using its own hygienic drying technology. In this process, the clear and transparent color of the newly harvested rice is saved and the fragrance of freshly cooked rice remains intact.
